Bourtange
=========
Bourtange is a game where you defend a number of planet-bases from a never ending onslaught of bad guys. Destroying intruders builds up your supply of resources, which in turn can be spent on new weapons and cores (the canonical base element). If you fail to keep your cores protected, the game ends. A winning game can be considered building your defenses to protect the bases indefinitely.
